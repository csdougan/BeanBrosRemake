# Bean Brothers remake
Bean Brothers is a 2018 game made by Dave Hughes for ZX Spectrum 48/128K.

I am working in a 2023 remake for the ZX Spectrum Next / NGo, with permission (and encouragement) from the original author.

As I am using Godot for prototyping, there is a (very limited) [HTML5 version you can try](https://dcrespo3d.github.io/BeanBrosRemake/).

The project is being developed using:

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for prototyping
- The [Z88DK C compiler](https://z88dk.org/site/)
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for pixel art editing
- Custom [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) scripts for levels and art conversion
